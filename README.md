# Talking Data: Comparing Favorites Starter Code

A project dedicated towards comparing the rating of The LEGO Movie to other Action & Adventure Movies

### Project Requirements

My project includes the following:

- Using a variable to store and print the data of my favorite movie.
- Using .loc to filter the data set to a genre, and storing it in a new variable.
- Calculating the min, max, mean, and median of a column.
- Printing how the min, max mean, and median compare to my favorite movie's value.
- Creating a histogram and using a print statement to describe it.
- Creating a scatter plot and using a print statement to describe the relationship between two variables.
